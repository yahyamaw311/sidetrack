SIDETRACK — TODO
=================

## 🎨 UI / UX Polish
- [ ] Animated page transitions (shared element: poster image from list → detail)
- [ ] Skeleton loading screens for Movie/Episode detail (instead of spinner)
- [ ] Haptic feedback on star rating, favoriting, and watchlist toggle
- [ ] Swipe-to-delete in Watchlist and History (instead of long-press)
- [ ] Dark/light theme toggle (Settings screen)
- [ ] Custom app icon selector
- [ ] Splash screen with animated logo

## 📺 Discovery & Browse
- [ ] Genre filter chips on Explore (Action, Comedy, Drama, etc.)
- [ ] "Top Rated" section (all-time best rated shows/movies)
- [ ] "Coming Soon" section — upcoming releases with air dates
- [ ] Infinite scroll / pagination for search results
- [ ] Recent searches history (persist locally)
- [ ] "Similar Shows" / "Recommended" section on detail pages
- [ ] Cast & crew section on detail pages (tap to see their other work)
- [ ] Trailers — embed YouTube trailer on Movie/Episode detail

## 📊 Stats & Insights (new tab or section)
- [ ] Total hours watched (movies + episodes runtime)
- [ ] Monthly/weekly watch streak calendar (GitHub-style heatmap)
- [ ] Average rating you give vs IMDb average
- [ ] Most-watched genre breakdown (pie chart)
- [ ] "Year in Review" summary (top-rated, most-watched genre, total count)
- [ ] Rating distribution histogram (how many 1-star, 2-star, etc.)

## 📝 Logging & Tracking
- [ ] Edit a watched entry (change rating, date, review after saving)
- [ ] Bulk mark episodes as watched (select range: "Mark S1 E1–E10")
- [ ] Watch progress bar on show cards (e.g. "12/62 episodes")
- [ ] Rewatch count badge on History entries
- [ ] Import/export watch history (JSON or CSV backup)
- [ ] "Dropped" status for shows you stopped watching

## 🔔 Notifications & Reminders
- [ ] New episode air date reminders for watchlisted shows
- [ ] "Continue watching" push notification if inactive for N days
- [ ] Weekly digest: "You watched X this week"

## 👥 Social
- [ ] Share a rating/review as an image card (Instagram story-style)
- [ ] Public profile with watch stats
- [ ] Friends list — see what friends are watching
- [ ] Activity feed of friend ratings

## 🔧 Technical / Under the Hood
- [ ] Migrate storage from AsyncStorage → MMKV (faster reads/writes)
- [ ] Offline mode — cache last-viewed detail pages for offline reading
- [ ] Image caching with expo-image (faster poster loads)
- [ ] Background sync for Currently Watching list
- [ ] Unit tests for StorageProvider methods
- [ ] E2E tests with Detox or Maestro
- [ ] App size optimization — lazy-load detail screens
- [ ] Deep linking (open show/movie from shared URL)

## 🧹 Code Quality
- [ ] Extract ShowInfoCard from EpisodeDetail (About the Show section)
- [ ] Shared detail header component (Movie + Episode share backdrop layout)
- [ ] Centralized error handling hook (useApiCall with loading/error states)
- [ ] Move all magic numbers to theme constants
- [ ] Add TypeScript strict mode
