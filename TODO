Bugs to Fix
Movie favorites aren't persisted — the heart button in MovieDetail only toggles local state, never saves to storage. There's no toggleFavoriteMovie in StorageProvider at all.
Logging the same movie twice silently overwrites — storage keys by movieId, so a rewatch replaces the original entry (date + rating lost).
Tapping a person in search results crashes — TMDB multi-search returns people, but the app tries to open them as a TV show.
MovieDetail shows infinite loading on API failure — if the network call fails, movie stays null and you're stuck on the loading screen.
getRatingColor thresholds differ across screens — a 6.5-rated show appears "good" on Discovery but "mid" on details.


UX Improvements
No search debouncing — every keystroke fires an API call (flickering results, wasted requests).
No pull-to-refresh on any list screen (Discovery, Saved, History).
Watched episodes are invisible — the app stores them but never displays them. History only shows movies.
No delete confirmation on Saved tab — WatchlistScreen deletes immediately, HistoryScreen asks first.
Long-press to delete in History isn't discoverable — no visual hint.
No way to un-mark an episode as watched once logged.
Discovery only shows trending TV shows — no trending movies until you search.
Performance
Mass parallel IMDb API calls — expanding a 20-episode season fires 40+ simultaneous HTTP requests. Needs concurrency limiting.
No API response caching — navigating to a detail, going back, and tapping again makes fresh requests every time.
FlatList inside ScrollView on DiscoveryScreen disables virtualization (React Native warning).
EpisodeDetail is 1200+ lines — a single component with 15+ useState calls; should be split up.
Error Handling
No error boundaries — any unhandled exception white-screens the app.
No offline detection — all screens silently show empty content when there's no internet.
No API timeout — a stalled request hangs forever.
Want me to start implementing any of these? I'd suggest tackling them in this order:

Persist movie favorites + add StorageProvider method
Add search debouncing
Filter out "person" results from search
Show watched episodes in History tab
Add pull-to-refresh to list screens
Add concurrency limiting to IMDb batch fetches
